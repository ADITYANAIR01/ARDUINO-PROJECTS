Here is the list of sensors to be used in this project 
1.Flame sensor 
2.pir sensor 
3.FC-22 gas sensor
4.Soil moisture sensor
5.HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor 
6.RFID-RC522 SENSOR
7.DHT11 Temperature sensor 
8.IR sensor 
9.Node MCU ESP8255MOD
10.Buzzer 
11.Jumper wires m-m,m-f,f-f.
12.Servo motor 
13.water pump 12v 


here is how the sensor should ideally function for me 

*flame sensor should be able to notify using buzzer if there is fire
*pir sensor should detect the movement and open the gate using servo motor 
*FC-22 gas sensor should notify the buzzer if it detects the gas 
*Soil moisture sensor will trigger the water pump if the soil is dry and turn off the motor when the soil is moist 
*ultrasonic sensor should give a notification on the serial out put if there is any movement 
*RFID-RC522 SENSOR will be installed in door of the model and will open the gate only if the right key is provided.rfid sensor will trigger the servo motor in the gate and it will open then will close after 2 min 
*dht 11 temperature sensor should be able to notify using buzzer if there is sudden rise of temperature 
*ir sensor will be integrated in the door and will make buzzer beep when the door closes and opens 

Additional things to provide me with 
* CODE FOR THE ABOVE USE CASE 
* GUIDE ME WITH THE CONNECTION OF PINS FROM SINGLE NODE MCU TO MULTIPLE SENSORS USING BREADBOARD 
* HOW TO CONNECT BREADBOARD WITH MULTIPLE SENSORS 
* FULL AND RUN EFECTIVE CODE
