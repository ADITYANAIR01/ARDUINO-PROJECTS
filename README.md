* In this repository you will find the codes of individual sensors as well as the combined code.

* If you want to see the individual code of sensors you can see them directly from this repository.

* I have tried to write the code of the sensors to be understandable by the respected teachers and users by using simple variables and COMMENTING OUT THE USEFUL INFORMATION.

* THe issues and problems of the code to be solved will be mentioned above the real code.

* I have provided the ways to install and use ARDUINO UNO, ESP8266 NODE MCT(0.9 DEV KIT) & ESP32 DEV KIT.

* Drivers to be installed are too given in the folder STEPS TO USE ARDUINO AND NODE MCU.
